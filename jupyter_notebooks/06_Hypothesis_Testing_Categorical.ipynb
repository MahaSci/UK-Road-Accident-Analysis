    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Accident severity is dependent on light conditions.\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H₀): Accident severity is independent of light conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rationale\n",
    "Environmental factors, such as light conditions, can influence the severity of accidents. Poor visibility in low-light conditions (e.g., nighttime) may contribute to more serious accidents. By testing this hypothesis, we aim to determine if light conditions have a significant impact on the severity of accidents\n",
    "\n",
    "> According to J. Loren, \"Low light conditions can lead to increased auto accident risk due to reduced driver visibility, increased reaction time, and difficulty assessing road conditions.\"[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Analysis & Validation Approach\n",
    "To explore this hypothesis, we will conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).\n",
    "\n",
    "This will involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating a contingency table for Accident Severity vs. Light Conditions to examine how the two variables are related.\n",
    "- Visualising the data using a bar plot to compare accident severity across different light conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the EDA, we will use the Chi-square test of independence to statistically test whether there is a significant relationship between accident severity and light conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chi-square test: This will help us determine if accident severity is independent of light conditions. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we will reject the null hypothesis and conclude that light conditions affect accident severity.\n"
